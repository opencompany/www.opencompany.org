<blockquote>

    &ldquo;The world needs people who see something that needs to be done and
    start to do it, without permission or advice. They just start doing
    it.&rdquo; — Wendell Berry

</blockquote>

If your company proactively maximizes trust through genuine transparency and
openness, you are an open company, full stop. You don't need our permission or
advice. That said, if you would like to join with like-minded companies in the
Open Company Initiative, please email [Tim
Cook](mailto:tim@saxifrageschool.org) (or submit a [pull
request](https://github.com/opencompany/opencompany.github.io/blob/master/_data/directory.yml))
with the following information:

  1. Your name and title;
  1. The name of your company;
  1. A link to your homepage, or a landing page about openness;
  1. A logo file (SVG preferred);
  1. A one-line description of your company;
  1. One concrete example of how your company already fulfills our pledge.
